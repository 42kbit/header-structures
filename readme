Data structures!
Meta of the project is to create a simple yet efficent to use 
one header data structures, with minimized header dependency.

current dependency:
	string.h in array.h (memmove needed)

current priority:
	RED-BLACK TREE. (after it's completion, bin_tree.h will
		pass away... sadly)
TESTS:
Tested with 256*256*256 (16 mil) operations of insert.
	BIN TREE:
		RAND INSERT: 22 SEC
		INORDERED INSERT: 2M30SEC THAN SEGFAULT
		FIND: O(log2 n) < O(n) < O(n)
	RED-BLACK TREE:
		RAND INSERT: 25 SEC
		INORDERED INSERT: 10 SEC
		FIND: O(log2 n)

For use just simply copy headers to your project!

Idea from list.h file from linux kernel.
God bless open source!
