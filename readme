Data structures!
Meta of the project is to create a simple yet efficent to use 
one header data structures, with minimized header dependency.

current dependency:
	string.h in array.h (memmove needed)

current priority:
	RED-BLACK TREE. (after it's completion, bin_tree.h will
		pass away... sadly)

For use just simply copy headers to your project!

Idea from list.h file from linux kernel.
God bless open source!
