SPEED:
Tested with 256*256*256 (16 mil) operations of insert.
	BIN TREE:
		RAND INSERT: 22 SEC
		INORDERED INSERT: 2M30SEC THAN SEGFAULT 
			(STACKOVERFLOW due to insert depth)
		FIND: log2 n <= O(n) <= n
	RED-BLACK TREE:
		RAND INSERT: 25 SEC
		INORDERED INSERT: 10 SEC
		FIND: O(n) = log2 n (or so)

MEMORY:
